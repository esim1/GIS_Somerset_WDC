## Proposed Warehouses

About 60 percent of proposed warehouses in Franklin Township would require a non-industrial land use conversion. Proposed warehouse site plans would redevelop 71.9 acres of office buildings, 49.82 acres of solar panel fields, and 19.12 acres of greenfield.

## The Social Landscape of Industrial Redevelopment

Franklin's current and proposed warehouses (illustrated in red below) are located in block groups with lower income levels and lower population density. The densest population centers are in the neighboring municipalities of South Bound Brook and Manville.
